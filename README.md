# CodSoft-Data-Science-Intern-Task-03
In this repository, I've completed task-03 as Data Science Intern at CodSoft. It involved exploring a real-world credit card fraud dataset, data preprocessing, handling data imbalance issues, and developing ML models for fraud detection. The primary goal was to detect fraudulent transactions effectively using a range of machine learning algorithms.
