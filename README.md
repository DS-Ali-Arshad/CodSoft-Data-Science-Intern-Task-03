# **CODSOFT-Data-Science-Intern-Task-03**

Welcome to my CODSOFT Data Science Internship repository for Task-03. This repository documents the work completed during the third task of my Data Science internship at CODSOFT. The task involved working with a real-world credit card fraud dataset and building machine learning models for fraud detection.

## Dataset
For this task, we used a real credit card fraud dataset, which contains information about various transactions, including features like time, amount, and other anonymized variables. The dataset can be found in the 'Dataset' folder.

## Data Preprocessing
We performed essential data preprocessing tasks, such as handling missing values, handling data imbalance problem, detecting and removing duplicate records, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. This involved visualizing the distribution of features and identifying patterns that might be useful for fraud detection. The EDA results can be found in the ' CodSoft_Task03_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb ' file.

## Machine Learning Models
Several machine learning models were implemented, including Support Vector Classification (SVC), Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting. Each model was evaluated for its effectiveness in detecting fraudulent transactions. The code for these models is available in the 'CodSoft_Task03_Credit_Card_Fraud_Detection.ipynb' file.

## Results
The models were evaluated, and their performance was assessed. The accuracy results are summarized in the 'Results' folder.

## Conclusion
In completing this task, we gained valuable experience in working with imbalanced datasets, data preprocessing, and machine learning for fraud detection. The results of this task will be instrumental in making informed decisions regarding fraud detection in real-world scenarios.
